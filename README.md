Hi Everyone,



I’ve developed a Tetris game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’d love to share it with you. The game includes core functionality such as:



1. Tetromino Movement and Rotation: Fully functional logic for controlling tetrominoes, allowing players to rotate, move left or right, and drop pieces.



2. Line Clearing: The game automatically detects and clears filled lines, updating the score accordingly.



3. Game Over Mechanism: A game over condition is triggered when new tetrominoes can no longer be placed.



4. Responsive Design: The game adjusts to different screen sizes for a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.



5. Smooth Animations: Rendering and movement are optimized using requestAnimationFrame() for smooth gameplay.
